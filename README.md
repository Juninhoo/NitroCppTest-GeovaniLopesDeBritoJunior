in order to build the code:
1) download and extract the ZIP file to a directory in your computer
2) Install CMake
3) Install vscode
4) Install Git
5) open the project folder
6) create a build directory
7) Run this command: cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 16 2019"
8) this will build the executables you can use to run
9) run :  ./rectangle_build ../rectangles.json
10) to run the tests you should run: ctest --build . --output-on-failure

in any case, a simple way to test it is to go on project folder->build->Debug and run from there the available executables


you Also have the .sln files which can be opened in vscode a you can build and run from there. As well as build the tests and run the tests.

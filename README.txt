in order to build the code:

download and extract the ZIP file to a directory in your computer
Install CMake
Install vscode
Install Git
open the project folder
create a build directory
Run this command: cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 16 2019"
this will build the executables you can use to run
run : ./rectangle_build ../rectangles.json
to run the tests you should run: ctest --build . --output-on-failure
in any case, a simple way to test it is to go on project folder->build->Debug and run from there the available executables

you Also have the .sln files which can be opened in vscode a you can build and run from there. As well as build the tests and run the tests.
